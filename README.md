- 👋 Hi, I’m @yumnarefai
- 👀 I’m interested in rescuing people from their boredom through the innovation of better entertained products. [netflix + spotify you're pardoned:)] 
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Java as well as making a Java project with my group! I cannot wait for the results!
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate with UofT CS community on beginner Java based projects and then progress to more complex ones!
- 📫 How to reach me? Send me a message on instagram yumna.refai_xoxo and we can communicate. 
- Happy coding, everyone!
